                We may use Google Analytics to track and analyze certain traffic and usage statistics regarding the use of our Platform, such as the number of visitors to our Platform, how visitors are navigating to our Platform, visitors’ general geographic region information, how long individuals are visiting our Platform, and information about the equipment individuals are using to access our Platform (e.g., browser version and operating system).

The information collected includes demographic information about our Platform visitors and general information about our visitors’ interests. We use the information collected through our use of the Google Analytics Advertising Features to track our Platform visitors’ patterns and behaviors, segment our audience, and to better target our advertising and marketing efforts (for our own products and services), for example to (1) display targeted advertisements to individuals who viewed a product or service but did not purchase the product or service, (2) target visitors from a certain geographic region with certain ads in Google search results that have previously shown a high degree of success for consumers in that region, (3) advertise our products and services across other websites and applications that you may visit, or (4) allow Google or other third-party vendors to show you ads on websites and applications that you visit after using our Platform or clicking on an offer or ad in one of our e-mails or in our Platform. </p>
